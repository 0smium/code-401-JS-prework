# Code 401: Advanced Software Development in Full-Stack JavaScript

### Pre-work

This is mandatory pre-work for Code 401: JavaScript that counts as 5% of your total course grade. When this course nears its start date, you will be invited to an online portal named Canvas where you can confirm that you've completed this prework and claim credit.

Start on the pre-work as soon as you can and be sure to allow yourself plenty of time to complete it. Allow yourself more time than you think you will need so that you can take breaks.

##### 1. Setup your computer with Terminal, Git, GitHub, and Slack: 
##### 2. Install Node the right way, following the instructions found [here](https://gist.github.com/toastynerd/d3e563522977f6750c32)

### Optional Pre-work
If you have time and want to review some Javscript fundamentals there are two main resources you should look at. First is [eloquent javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) the second is the [you don't know js series](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) especially the "Scopes and Closures" and "this & Object Prototypes" books.
